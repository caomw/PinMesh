# PinMesh
PinMesh is an exact and efficient parallel algorithm for preprocess a polyhedral triangular mesh and, then, query a cloud of points against the mesh. 



## Datasets
* Table below presents the source and creator of the original datasets used to created the examples in this repository.
* The original datasets were cleaned (to ensure they are watertight and do not have topological errors) and converted to the file format used by PinMesh.
