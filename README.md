# PinMesh
PinMesh is an exact and efficient parallel algorithm for preprocess a polyhedral triangular mesh and, then, query a cloud of points against the mesh. 

PinMesh is described in the following paper:  Magalh√£es SVG, et al. PinMesh - Fast and exact 3D point location queries using a uniform grid. Comput Graph (2016), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cag.2016.05.017i 


## Datasets (available at:  )
* Table below presents the source and creator of the original datasets used to created the examples in this repository.
* The original datasets were cleaned (to ensure they are watertight and do not have topological errors) and converted to the file format used by PinMesh.
* The datasets with 6, 12 and 24 materias were created as the union of the 6 largest single-material datasets.
